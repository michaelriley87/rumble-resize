# Rumble Resize

Rumble Resize is a Chrome plugin designed to enhance your viewing experience on Rumble by making the Theatre Mode fill the entire browser window. Whether you
prefer to watch with or without the live chat, Rumble Resize ensures a seamless, immersive viewing experience. Additionally, you can still scroll down the page 
without any interruptions. Enjoy Rumble videos in full-screen mode like never before!

## Functionality
- **Dynamic Element Detection:** Waits for the theatre mode button to appear in the DOM with a 2-minute timeout.
- **Custom CSS Injection:** Injects and removes custom CSS via the theater mode button to make the video player fill the browser window and hide unnecessary elements.
- **Flexible Viewing:** Works with chat and sidebar menu on or off to ensure seamless viewing. Permits page scrolling to see video details and the comments section.
